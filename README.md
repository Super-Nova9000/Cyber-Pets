This is a game I made for school is C#, based on a Cyber Pets style game.

The original scope for this project involved using Unity or Godot to create 2D graphics, however this was abandoned because I ran out of time to submit this project.

This was created using Object Oriented Programming and uses 4 classes and 1 main file.

Any bugs, please ping me a message and I'll look into them.

Again, this is fairly barebones as I ran out of time.
